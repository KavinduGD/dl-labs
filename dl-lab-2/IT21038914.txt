  when iterations get higher error get reduced that means accuracy get higher

1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
When the number of hidden nodes increases, the accuracy of the model initially increases significantly. However, after a certain point, the increase in the number of hidden nodes results in a marginal increase or even a plateau in accuracy.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
The pattern observed in the plot can be explained as follows:

Initial Increase in Accuracy: When the number of hidden nodes is very small (e.g., 1 or 2), the model might not have enough capacity to capture the complexity of the data. As a result, the accuracy is relatively low. As the number of hidden nodes increases, the model gains more capacity to learn and represent the underlying patterns in the data, leading to a significant increase in accuracy.

Diminishing Returns: After reaching a certain number of hidden nodes (e.g., around 10 nodes in this case), the accuracy starts to level off. This is because the model has sufficient capacity to capture the data's complexity, and adding more nodes does not provide substantial new information or improvement. This results in diminishing returns in terms of accuracy improvement.

Potential Overfitting: Although not clearly visible in this plot, if the number of hidden nodes were increased further, the model might start overfitting the training data, especially if the training data is not large or diverse enough. Overfitting would lead to a decrease in the model's generalization ability, which might not be immediately apparent in the training accuracy but would affect the test accuracy.
